    "and once you have to do this nearly every day,\n",
    "you will be glad for the assistance.\n",
    "The situation is similar to coding up your own blog from scratch.\n",

    "rather than having to focus on the implementation.\n",
    "We will first define a model variable `net`,\n",
    "which will refer to an instance of the `Sequential` class.\n",
    "The `Sequential` class defines a container\n",
    "for several layers that will be chained together.\n",
    "Given input data, a `Sequential` instance passes it through\n",
    "the first layer, in turn passing the output\n",
    "as the second layer's input and so forth.\n",
    "In the following example, our model consists of only one layer,\n",
    "so we do not really need `Sequential`.\n",
    "But since nearly all of our future models\n",
    "will involve multiple layers,\n",
    "we will use it anyway just to familiarize you\n",
    "with the most standard workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the architecture of a single-layer network as shown in :numref:`fig_single_neuron`.\n",
